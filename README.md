# Wireless Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System Using Arduino and Bluetooth <br/>
# Introduction <br/>
This project demonstrates the implementation of a wireless temperature and humidity monitoring system using an Arduino Uno, DHT11 sensor, and HC-05/HC-06 Bluetooth module. Real-time data is transmitted to an Android application created with MIT App Inventor, which displays the temperature and humidity readings.
